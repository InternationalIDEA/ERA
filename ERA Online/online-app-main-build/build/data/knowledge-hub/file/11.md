³⁰The Representation Commission has seven members. Four of them are *ex-officio* (members in a public service institution) general surveyors, Governmental statistics expert, Election official head, and head of the Regional Government Commission. Two members are appointed by the Governor-General, following a nomination by the parliament; one represents the Government party (no voting right in the Commission) and another one representing the Opposition party. The seventh Representation Commission member is nominated by other members and appointed by the Governor-General. This seventh member is the chairperson of the Commission. Since the Representation Commission was formed in 1956, the chairperson is always from the judiciary (ACE Project).

³²In creating the Māori electoral districts, the Representation Commission receives three more members: the *ex officio* Executive Head of the Ministry of Māori Development and two additional members appointed by the Governor-General who are both Māori. These three members join the Commission to provide a perspective on the interests of the Māori community (ACE Project).

³⁶The total population based on the latest population census will be subtracted by the number of Māori citizens. The Māori population number is obtained from the ratio of Māori voters to the total voter count. The government statistician then implements the proportion to the number of people who claim to be Māori descent in the latest population census. Then, to determine the number of seats allocated to Māori electoral districts, the number of voters in the Southern Island is divided by the quota of 16 seats for the Southern Island (ACE Project).

⁴⁰The federal constitution of Malaysia states that the parliamentary election should be done at least once every five years. In fact, since the Malaysian independence in 1957, elections have been held every fifth year. (ACE Poject).

⁴¹For the parliamentary electoral district assessment, the federal regions of Kuala Lumpur, Labuan, and Putrajaya will be considered as states (Malaysian federal constitution).

⁴²In the federal constitution, there are two measurements used to observe the proportionality of district magnitude and seat allocation: election quota and citizen quota. Election quota is a number obtained by dividing the number of voters in a federal region or state by the number of total electoral districts, or if possible, the number of electoral districts in that state. Meanwhile the citizen quota is a number obtained by dividing the population of the federal region or state by the total number of electoral districts, or depending on the situation, the number of electoral districts in that state.

⁴³With the government’s electoral redistricting design.

⁴⁴The Election Commission consists of 5 members. All members are appointed by the Highest Authority by consulting the Authority Conference, i.e., a body consisting of executives of all states. All five members can sit at the Election Commission until they retire at 65, and can be terminated from their office only by a special court initiated by the Prime Minister.
