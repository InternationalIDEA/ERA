After drawing the electoral districts, the next step is conducting public consultation that involves various parties starting from political parties, citizen communities/groups, election observers, governmental institutions in charge of citizenship and spatial mapping, and so on. This public consultation is important to obtain inputs on the electoral district drafts, to see whether they have fulfilled the standards and principles of electoral districting.
